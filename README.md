# To-Do-List-Nodejs

![alt text](https://prnt.sc/25wptz2.png)

## This is a To-Do list web app made with nodejs, express, sequelize,MySQL and handlebars

## This repository is without the node modules, and you will need to install with npm:

* "express": "^4.17.2",
* "express-handlebars": "^6.0.2",
* "mysql2": "^2.3.3",
* "nodemon": "^2.0.15",
* "sequelize": "^6.12.0"

I also advise you to install the workbench on your machine to make it easier to deal with the database
