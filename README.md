## This is a To-Do list web app made with nodejs, express, sequelize,MySQL and handlebars

## This repository is without the node modules, and you will need to install with npm:

* "express": "^4.17.2",
* "express-handlebars": "^6.0.2",
* "mysql2": "^2.3.3",
* "nodemon": "^2.0.15",
* "sequelize": "^6.12.0"

* I also advise you to install the workbench on your machine to make it easier to deal with the database

To run this application you will need to install all node modules, a MySQL server configured in your machine(recommend you to use MySQL server(A GUI MySQL program)), and choose a port to use.

In the future i will deploy this application on heroku.
